# IEEE-754 Converter

The **IEEE-754 Converter** is a Python program that allows you to convert decimal numbers to the IEEE-754 format and vice versa. It supports single precision (32 bits) for the IEEE-754 format by default, and double precision (64 bits) can be enabled by modifying the code. The program is designed to work with both Python and on a TI-Nspire calculator, making it versatile and accessible for a wider range of users.

## Features

- Convert decimal numbers to IEEE-754 format (single precision by default).
- Convert IEEE-754 format numbers back to decimal.
- Compatible with both Python and TI-Nspire calculators.

## Usage

1. Choose the option corresponding to the operation you want to perform:
   - Type `1` to convert a decimal number to IEEE-754.
   - Type `2` to convert an IEEE-754 number to decimal.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number and observe the conversion.

## Enabling Double Precision

Double precision (64 bits) is disabled by default for the IEEE-754 format. If you want to enable it, you will need to modify the code. Instructions for enabling double precision can be found within the code comments.

## How to Use in Python

If you're running this code in a Python environment, make sure you have Python installed. You can run the program in your favorite Python environment. No additional setup is required.

## How to Use on TI-Nspire Calculator

This code is also designed to work on TI-Nspire calculators. Here's how you can run it on your TI-Nspire:

1. Make sure your TI-Nspire calculator is in Python mode.
2. Transfer the code to your calculator using the provided method (typically through a computer connection).
3. Run the code on your calculator as you would with any Python program.
